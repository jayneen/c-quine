# proof-of-concept-c-quine
A proof of concept self-replicating quine written in C. It replicates itself within the same directory with a new name and runs the new file. This version is limited to 5 copies after which it stops running; the current file naming conventions do not support more than 9 iterations. The code is for educational purposes only and performs no malicious operations.
